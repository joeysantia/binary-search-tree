# Binary Search Tree Project

Binary search tree project for The Odin Project. I created a Tree class that accepts an array and constructs a balanced binary tree upon initialization. The Tree class can also perform the following methods:

1. Insert a new node 
2. Delete an existing node
3. Find a node with a given value
4. Breadth-first search
5. Depth-first search (preorder, inorder, and postorder)
6. Find the height of the tree
7. Find the depth of a given node
8. Determine whether the tree is balanced
9. Rebalance the tree
10. Build a balanced tree from a randomly generated array
